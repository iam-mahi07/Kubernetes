Hey! Welcome to the Container Orchestration world of K8s!ðŸ‘‹

This repo helps you to gain knowledge from scratch to an advanced/pre-advanced level on Kubernetes. I promise!

What you'd learn?

You'd learn what is Container Orchestration, why K8s, what is a Pod and container, K8s architecture, K8s clusters, K8s services, K8s controllers, deployment strategies,  K8s ingress, K8s package management, K8s configMaps and secrets, K8s Volumes PV and PVC. You'd go through almost all these concepts with a practical demonstration.

NOTE: This repo is still work in progres, more information on different concepts beyond advanced can be added in the future and I'm open to any suggestions/corrections if there are any.

Many thanks for visiting!
